# Reporting
The reporting module provides an overview of today's bookings.

## Report by `Type` and `Status`
This is the base page for the reporting module. It provides the following information:

- Today's average float time
- Yesterday's average float time
- Percentage difference between today's and yesterday's average float times

- Rental status by type
- Availability by type:
    - Total `RaftMap` by type minus those under repair
- Total bookings for the day
- Total rentals for the day

- Filtered bookings based on user selection

## Report by `Hour`
This page shows the count of each type and the total per hour.

- Filtered bookings based on user selection

## Finding Records
Within the reporting module, the user can select any chip in the first report (or any row in the second hourly report page) to display a list of the selected bookings. 

## Managing Records
Within the report selection, booking records can be viewed and managed like normal, and can even check rafts in/out as if in its respective mode. This behaviour is automated based on the status of the booking.
