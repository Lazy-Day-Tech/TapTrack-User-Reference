# 1.5.9

## What's New
- **Dynamic Waiver Display in BookingRecordView**  
  The waiver section now adjusts based on the number of signed waivers to prevent UI issues with long dialogs:  
  - Up to 4 waivers: displayed normally  
  - 5–7 waivers: "Show more" option added to reveal up to 7 waivers  
  - 8 or more waivers: displayed in a separate dialog
- **Organizer Field Update**  
  - Increased the maximum number of display lines from 1 to 2 for better visibility
- **New “Scroll to Top” Button**  
  - Added to both *ManualInput* and *ShuttleManualInput* for easier navigation
- **ShuttleManualInput Refresh Fix**  
  - Fixed an issue where the refresh button didn’t update the filtered records properly
- **Flags Dropdown UI Fix**  
  - Improved the behavior of the Flags dropdown to prevent it from breaking the dialog layout on large booking records
