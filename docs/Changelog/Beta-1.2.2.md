- You can now check-in a booking without using NFC. Good as a backup in case tag isnt working properly or is damaged
- rentalResources now function correctly with the backend
- Improved manual filtering logic to use both bookingDateTime OR startDateTime if relevant 
- New "Alert" Snackbar component to alert users of failed attempts
