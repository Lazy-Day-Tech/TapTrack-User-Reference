# Beta-1.4.1
- Multiplatform ViewModel Support
- Reports Module V2 (Early implementation)
- Added an additional check and dialog for the `Shuttle Management Module`
  - If QR code doesnt have active shuttle seats listed in record, it will now display an alert dialog
- Customer Acknowledgement will now reinitialize `BookingRecordView` after sign off ensuring the flow of the check-in process remains smooth as possible
