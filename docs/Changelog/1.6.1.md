# 1.6.0

## What's New
- You can now cycle between next/previous reports in ReportHistory
- Improved Constants
    - Added mappings for naming convention translations
    - Added `Rental` support for 2-person rafts
    - Fixed BowYak naming to support FareHarbor naming conventions
    - Added static `SHUTTLE_CAPACITY` to `Shuttle`
    - Added `RaftMap` BowYak value
- Asset rebranding
    - Changed all LD specific assets to new TagTrax assets on all platforms
- New Shuttle Overview Report
    - This report displays a summary of booking information and available shuttle seats for each shuttle. This report is intended for use within the Shuttle Management Module.
    - The table for this report is dynamic based on bookings for the hour. If there is no bookings for an hour, it will be exempt from the report.
    - Available shuttle seats is calculated with the maximum shuttle capacity minus booked shuttle seats within that hour
    - Requires the `shuttle.report` and `shuttle.perform` user permissions to access
- Shuttle Management Module Cleanup
    - Removed old redundant fetching and filtering logic to get only bookings with shuttle seats as this is now handled by the backend (Greatly increasing performance)
    - Added phone number lookup option to `ShuttleManualInput`
    - Improved local `findMatchingQRCode` lookup to use new `CheckIn_URL` backend value
        - Will now also use a direct backend lookup (`fetchMostRecentBookingByQRCode()`) if no `list` provided, rather than local lookup logic
- User Lookup Improvements
    - Removed old (less secure) user lookup functions
    - Added distinction for user permission collection
        - For cases where a user has multiple roles each containing any of the same permissions
