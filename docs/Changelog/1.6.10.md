# 1.6.10

## What's New:
- **Check-In/Check-Out Module**
    - **Booking Reset**
        - Users now have the ability to reset a booking from `BookingRecordView`
        - This allows users to change the rentals checked into a booking if a mistake or change has been made
    - **Kayak/Alphanumeric Manual Rental Entry Automatic Case Handling**
        - Any rental numbers with alphanumeric values will now be automatically converted to the correct format before being passed to the backend for lookup
    - **Raft Number Lookup in `ManualInput`**
        - Users can now look up booking by raft number once the queried rental is checked in
    - **Single Waiver Approval**
        - Waivers now only need to be approved once by a single user, other users will not need to approve waivers once they are confirmed
    - **Waiver ApprovedBy Entry**
        - Users with the new `booking.waivers.approvedby.view` permission will be able to see which user approved the waivers for a booking
- **Shuttle Management Module**
    - **Shuttle Note Identifier in `ShuttleManualInput`**
        - This will display an icon on any booking that has shuttle notes written within the record
    - **Shuttle Note Filter in `ShuttleManualInput`**
        - There is not a new filter category called "Fields" that will display different fields within a record to search/display
        - Within this category, there is now an option to filter for only bookings that have a shuttle note associated with the booking. This category may be further expanded in the future
