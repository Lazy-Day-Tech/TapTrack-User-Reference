# 1.5.10

## What's New:
- Added status messages to progress indicator in ReportsV2
- Add progress statuses for Progress Indicator in `ReportsV2`. It will display a message for the following states:
	1. Fetching booking records
	2. Fetching rental availability
	3. Filtering rentals
- Added check for sufficient data in `FloatTime` view
	1. This allows for better performance (as it doesn't always need to run calculation logic) and management over custom null message and colour state management.
- Only display active hours (`total > 0`) in `ReportsHourly`
- Add `constants` for `rentals` and `status`
    - This makes it easy to modify the following values used across the application at any point
	1. Rentals
