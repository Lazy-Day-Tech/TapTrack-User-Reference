# 1.6.6

## What's New:
- Waiver Migration:
    - There was a backend issue with storing waiver data in Airtable Arrays. This has now been moved to a new data type that will be supported from this version onward
- Shuttle Management Module:
    - Fraud Detection
        - Bookings that have a red dot to the left of them in any location in the Shuttle Management Module, means that booking has been detected as potentially fraudulant and needs further verification
    - Remove customers from checked in count
        - Users of this module can now reduce the count of already checked-in customers
    - Shuttle Report Viewmodel state flow support
        - When using the Shuttle Report with the ShuttleRecordView in tandem, the shuttle report will recomposition if a change was made to the local viewmodel. 
        - In short, if the user uses the shuttle report to check shuttle seats in, they will no longer need to refresh after checking seats in, in order to confirm the changes in the shutlle report
            - Changes made by other staff will still require a refresh to validate
- Reporting Module:
    - Fixed 12-person rafts from being counted in 2-person raft list
    - Fixed total counts displaying incorrect value when 2-person rafts are present
- Check-In/Check-Out Module:
    - Added amount due flag:
        - If a customer still owes any payment, it will now display in BookingRecordView when either checking a booking in or out
    - Check-In Mode:
        - Added flag for potentially fraudulant bookings. If a booking is detected as potentially fraudulant, it will have a red dot next to the organizers name in BookingRecordView
- OpenWeather:
    - Added better handling for cases where some weather data is not included in the API response, breaking the forecast report
