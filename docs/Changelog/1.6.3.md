# 1.6.3
This release introduces major enhancements to the shuttle management module, new alerting features, weather integration, and improved booking check-in/check-out workflows. It also includes UI improvements, new permissions, and foundational support for upcoming weather forecast features.

### New Features
- Rescue Alerting
    - Users with the `rescue.alert.perform` permission can now initiate a rescue warning
    - This will send a rescue alert to users with `Rescue_SMS_Alert_Opt_In` enabled via SMS with booking information in addition to a Slack notification
- Users can now mark a booking as "Arrived"
    - This requires the `booking.arrived.perform` user permission
    - If a booking is marked as Arrived, it can be filtered in ManualInput
    - Once a booking has been fully checked-in, the Arrived status will be removed to make other ones easier to find
- Added refresh button to `ReportsV2`
- Add client side support for booking "No Show" functionality
- Shuttle Checkin count will now be reflected in `ShuttleManualInput`
    - Must have at least one shuttle seat checked-in for display
- Added `In Progress` filter to `ShuttleManualInput` to display shuttle bookings that have not been fully checked-in
- You can now filter shuttle bookings by hour in `ShuttleManualInput`
    - Filter options are dynamic based on the active shuttle bookings for the day
- OpenWeather Integration:
    - Support for new backend to sharing low-value API Keys at runtime
        - This makes key rotations codeless and increases security
    - New functions for working with OpenWeather API Features:
        - Current Weather Report
        - Hourly Forecast for 5 days by 3 hour intervals
    - New Auto-Refresh functionality to refresh weather information on a timer, always keeping it up to date
    - Pull weather icon directly from OpenWeather to display in UI
    - Display Current Weather in `ModeSelectionPage`
- Only users with new permission `repair.assignable` can be assigned repair records
- You can now access `ShuttleRecordView` directly from any Shuttle Management Module report
    - Added `shuttleMode` to `ReportLookupPage` to repurpose for use in the Shuttle Management Module reports
    - Also added color mode override parameter option to `ReportLookupPage`
        - Added new color scheme for `shuttleMode`:
            - No Shuttle seats -> Gray,
            - Fully Checked-In -> Green, 
            - Partially Checked-In -> Blue
- Users can now add "Shuttle Notes" from `ShuttleRecordView` either manually or promted after an overbook
- Added shuttle check-in counts to Shuttle Hourly Report
- Added new standardized `BasicTextField` dialog
- Added support for new "No Show" Booking status in existing filter options 

### Changes
- `ShuttleFullReport` will now display numbers based on seats rather than booking counts
- Improved `ManualInput` filtering logic to only include bookings with at least one item from `Rentals.all`
- You can now overbook a shuttle booking instead of being limited to only checking in a max of the number of seats booked (Users will be prompted to enter a shuttle note after an overbook so that they can be charged later)
- Added support for overbook cases in Shuttle Management Reports

### Bug Fixes
- Fix TableM3 max width UI bug
- Shortened Refresh button in `ManualInput` to fix UI issues with density in button row
- Fixed `ReportLookupPage` iOS specific UI bug caused by previous Compose 1.8.1 upgrade

### Coming Soon
