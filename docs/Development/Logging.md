# Logging
Logging for this application relys on [Kermit](https://github.com/touchlab/Kermit). Kermit is a Kotlin Multiplatform utility that supports multiplatform logging with shared Kotlin. It will use *LogCat* for Android, and *OSlog* for iOS.

Documentation for Kermit can be found [here](https://kermit.touchlab.co/docs/)
