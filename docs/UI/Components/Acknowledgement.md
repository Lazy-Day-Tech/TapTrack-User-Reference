# AcknowledgementCard Component

The `AcknowledgementCard` composable function is designed to present users with important information and obtain their acknowledgment through a text input field. This document outlines how this component functions and provides guidance on its usage.

## Overview

This component displays a card containing a title, a detailed description of the acknowledgment requirement, and an interactive text field where users can type "I Agree" to confirm their understanding. It is used within user interfaces that require explicit confirmation before proceeding with certain actions or conditions.

### Key Features

- **Informative Title**: The card features a bold, underlined title that clearly states what needs acknowledgment.
  
- **Detailed Description**: Provides users with comprehensive information about the terms or risks they are acknowledging.

- **Interactive TextField**:
  - Users type their acknowledgment ("I Agree") directly into the field.
  - Displays character count to guide input length (e.g., "/7" indicates a maximum of seven characters).

### Design Elements

- **Visual Styling**:
  - The card is styled with rounded corners and a subtle border, giving it a clean and modern appearance.
  - Text colors are managed using the `ColorScheme` for consistent theming across the application.

- **Components**:
  - **Title**: Bold and underlined to capture attention quickly.
  - **Description**: A brief explanatory text that sets context for the acknowledgment required.
  - **TextField**: Allows users to input their agreement, with real-time character count feedback.

## How to Use

1. **Set Up the Card**:
   - Provide a `title` that succinctly describes what is being acknowledged (e.g., "Weather Conditions").
   - Supply a detailed `description` explaining why acknowledgment is necessary.

2. **Manage User Input**:
   - Capture user input in the `textFieldValue` parameter, which should be initialized with an empty or default string.
   - Use the `onTextFieldValueChange` callback to handle changes in the text field's content and implement any logic needed when users type "I Agree".

3. **Customize Appearance** (Optional):
   - Apply additional modifiers to adjust the cardâ€™s layout, size, or position within the UI.
   - Adjust colors via `ColorScheme` if you need to align with different branding guidelines.
